## How to Use

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/unit/utils/helpers.test.js

# Run tests matching a pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should validate email"
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

After running `npm run test:coverage`:

1. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser
2. Navigate through files to see line-by-line coverage
3. Identify untested code paths
4. Add tests to improve coverage

### Writing New Tests

1. **For utility functions**: Add to `tests/unit/utils/`
2. **For models**: Add to `tests/unit/models/`
3. **For middleware**: Add to `tests/unit/middleware/`
4. **For API routes**: Add to `tests/integration/api/`

Follow the patterns in existing test files for consistency.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Run `npm install` to install testing dependencies
2. ✅ Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass
3. ✅ Run `npm run test:coverage` to see initial coverage
4. ✅ Review test files to understand patterns

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add More Integration Tests**

   - Auth routes (`/api/auth/*`)
   - User routes (`/api/users/*`)
   - Anime routes (`/api/anime/*`)

2. **Increase Coverage**

   - Add tests for edge cases
   - Test error handling paths
   - Add performance tests

3. **Add E2E Tests**

   - Consider adding Cypress or Playwright
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Test frontend integration

4. **Improve CI/CD**

   - Add pre-commit hooks (Husky)
   - Add code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
   - Add security scanning
   - Add performance benchmarks

5. **Documentation**
   - Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Create video tutorials
   - Add troubleshooting guides

## Maintenance

### Keeping Tests Updated

- Add tests for every new feature
- Update tests when changing functionality
- Remove tests for deprecated features
- Keep test dependencies up to date

### Monitoring Coverage

- Check coverage reports regularly
- Aim to maintain or improve coverage
- Focus on critical paths first
- Don't sacrifice quality for coverage percentage

### Best Practices

- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD)
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use descriptive test names
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Mock external dependencies
- Test behavior, not implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests timeout:**

- Increase timeout in `jest.config.js`
- Check for unresolved promises
- Ensure database connections close properly

**MongoDB Memory Server fails:**

- Check available disk space
- Try different MongoDB version
- Increase timeout for `beforeAll` hooks

**Module not found errors:**

- Verify path aliases in `jest.config.js`
- Check file paths are correct
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed

**Tests fail in CI but pass locally:**

- Check environment variables
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Check for timing-dependent tests

## Conclusion

The AniNotion project now has a robust, comprehensive testing framework that:

- Provides confidence in code changes
- Catches bugs early in development
- Serves as documentation for the codebase
- Enables safe refactoring and feature additions
- Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines

The testing infrastructure is designed to grow with the project and can easily accommodate new tests as features are added.
