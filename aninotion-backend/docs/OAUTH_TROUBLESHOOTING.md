# OAuth Implementation - Issue Fixed ‚úÖ

## Problem Encountered

**Error Message:**
```
TypeError: OAuth2Strategy requires a clientID option
```

## Root Cause

The `require('dotenv').config()` was being called **AFTER** requiring the passport configuration file. This meant that when `config/passport.js` tried to read `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, it was still `undefined`.

## Solution Applied

Moved `require('dotenv').config()` to the **very first line** of `server.js`, before any other imports.

### Before (‚ùå Wrong):
```javascript
const passport = require('./config/passport');
require('dotenv').config();  // ‚Üê Too late!
```

### After (‚úÖ Correct):
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();  // ‚Üê Load environment variables FIRST
const passport = require('./config/passport');
```

## Why This Matters

Node.js executes code synchronously during the require phase. When you `require('./config/passport')`, Node.js immediately executes that file, which tries to read environment variables. If dotenv hasn't loaded them yet, they're undefined.

## Testing

The server should now start successfully:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
üöÄ Server initializing...
‚úÖ Middleware configured successfully
‚úÖ MongoDB connected
Server running on port 5000
```

## Files Modified

1. **server.js** - Moved `require('dotenv').config()` to first line
2. **config/passport.js** - Removed session serialization (not needed for JWT auth)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Server starts without errors
2. Test OAuth endpoints:
   - `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/url`
   - `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google`
3. Implement frontend Google sign-in button

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED - Ready to Test**
